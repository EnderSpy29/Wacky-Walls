Easily preview all of the wallpapers here [Page](https://github.com/EnderSpy29/Wacky-Walls/blob/main/PAGE.MD)

Having collected these over the course of many years i don't know their exact sources. Among the few sources i know of are
Unixporn, Wallhaven, Reddit, Alphacoders and Github.

If you have git installed you can run `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EnderSpy29/Wacky-Walls.git` to clone to repo at its smallest possible size (`--depth 1` is calling only the most recent commit so you're not getting the entire git commit history when you clone the repo)

Otherwise download the images individually or download the repo by clicking on the blue "Code" button and then clicking download zip
